# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will leave a service (churn) based on historical behavioral and demographic data.

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze customer data and identify patterns that lead to churn. The goal is to help businesses retain valuable customers by predicting churn before it happens.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes features like:
- Customer ID
- Gender
- Tenure
- Monthly Charges
- Total Charges
- Contract Type
- Payment Method
- Internet Service
- Churn (target variable)

> You can use the popular [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy 📊  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈  
- Scikit-learn 🤖  
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 🔧 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizations to understand patterns

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score

---

## 📝 Results

- Best Model: `Random Forest Classifier`
- Accuracy: ~84%
- Insights:
  - Long tenure and paperless billing are key churn indicators.
  - Monthly charges affect churn probability.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Use deep learning for better accuracy
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
- Add customer segmentation
